This module provides a setup for creating web applications.

## Create a new Project
```
# Create a new project
npx fullstack-system new my-app

# NPM Modules are automatically installed, so you can
# start working right away.
cd my-app
npm start
```

## Documentation
You need two entry files in your project, one at `./src/server/index.js` and one at `./src/client/index.js`. Right now you cannot have these in other places.

## TODO
- CUSTOM: `src/index.html` Replace default blank template
- CUSTOM: `src/static` Extra static files
- CUSTOM: Webpack Configs.
- Fix logging in node console, it's crappy.
